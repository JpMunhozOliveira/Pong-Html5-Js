# Description 

This is a simple Pong game created in Unity. Pong is one of the most classic and iconic video games in gaming history. Originally released in 1972 by Atari, the game consists of a virtual ping-pong match where players control paddles and try to hit a ball back and forth across the opponent's field.

The game is considered one of the first commercially successful electronic games in history and helped popularize the electronic gaming industry as a whole.

Despite its simplicity, Pong is a challenging game that requires quick reflexes and skill to control the paddle. Additionally, the game can be played against both the computer and another player, making it a fun multiplayer option .
